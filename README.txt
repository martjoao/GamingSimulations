#Simulation of bouncing balls inside a box

USAGE: simulation.exe [gravity][drag][rest velocity][bounce force][number of spheres]
	gravity - gravity inside the box
	drag - force that slows down the speed of the balls (0 to 1)
	rest velocity - velocity that will be equal to 0
	bounce force - wall bounces may increase balls speed
	number of spheres - self explanatory
